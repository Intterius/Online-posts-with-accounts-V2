## Updated version of 'Online posts with accounts and database'.

The update of this project consists of being entirely created from scratch on React.js with some minor cool stuff, such as Bootstrap, React-Toastify, Json-Server, Axios and a small implementation of React-Redux for performance reason. This is my first React.js project, so please leave any pieces of advice and feedbacks. Stay safe!
