## Updated version of 'Online posts with accounts and database'.

The update of this project consists of being entirely created from scratch on React.js with some minor cool stuff, such as Bootstrap, React-Toastify, Json-Server, Axios and a small implementation of React-Redux for performance reason. This is my first React.js project, so please leave any pieces of advice and feedbacks. Stay safe!

## Demo Database

In case you want to see this project in action, I suggest downloading and starting my mini json-server from demo-database repository, to run it, write in command line 'npm run json:server', after that you will be able to work with it and try the project itself.

Added React-Redux for code readability and performance reasons, also have cleaned, deleted and improved some code in different files. In case you find a issue or a mistake from my part, please notice me.

Fixed the issue with register form when a user could have the same username or email, and merged all posts with user's own posts component for performance reasons.
